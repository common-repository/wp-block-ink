## Frequently Asked Questions ##

Where do I set my colors?

1. Go to Appearance ➡️ Customize ➡ Colors to choose and name colors. You can also disable the custom color picker for users.

What CSS classes are created?

Each color receives two CSS classes — one for text styling and one for background color. Reference the CSS added under Appearance ==> Block Ink --> CSS

What if my theme includes custom Gutenberg colors?

This plugin respects a theme’s custom colors by default. Check the status indicator on the Block Ink admin page or Plugin List to see where the color palette is being set.
